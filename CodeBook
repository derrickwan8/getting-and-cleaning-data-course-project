This document describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data

Steps:
1. Download the file with the file url (variable: url) and unzip it to working directory. 
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   i. Read the files below into tables into respective data set: 
      a. x_train.txt -> x_train
      b. y_train.txt -> y_train
      c. subject_train.txt -> s_train
      d. x_test.txt -> x_test
      e. y_test.txt -> y_test
      f. subject_test.txt -> s_test
      g. features.txt -> features
      h. activity_labels.txt -> activities
   ii. Merge the datasets as below:
      a. s_train, s_test -> s_data
      b. y_train, y_test -> y_data
      c. x_train, x_test -> x_data
   iii. rename columns for all data sets
      a. s_data <- column 'subject'
      b. y_data <- column 'activity'
      c. x_data <- get column names from features data set
      d. activities <- columns 'activity, activityName'
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  i. Get the values of column 2 from features data set with values that contains the string 'mean' or 'std'
  ii. Extract columns for mean and std to x_extracted data set
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  i. Merge all datasets to all_data
  ii. Replace activity id with column value of activityNames
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  i. Get all column names to variable columnNames
  ii. Find and replace short words in columnNames with descriptive words as below:
      a. Find and replace '()' and '-' to empty string
      b. Find and replace 'mean' to 'Mean'
      c. Find and replace 'std' to 'StandardDeviation'
      d. Find and replace 'Acc' to 'Accelerometer'
      e. Find and replace 'Gyro' to 'Gyroscope'
      f. Find and replace 'Mag' to 'Magnitude'
      g. Find and replace 'BodyBody' to 'Body'
      h. Find and replace first 't' to 'Time'
      g. Find and replace first 'f' to 'Frequency'
  iii. Rename columns with the names transformed (columnNames) in 4.ii above.
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  i. Group by columns subject, activityName.
  ii. Summarize all_data to TidyData data set by each measurement columns.
  iii. Output TidyData to file 'tidy_data.txt' in working directory
