This document describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data

Steps:
1. Download the file with the file url (variable: url) and unzip it. 
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   i. Read the files below into tables into respective variables: 
      a. x_train.txt -> x_train
      b. y_train.txt -> y_train
      c. subject_train.txt -> s_train
      d. x_test.txt -> x_test
      e. y_test.txt -> y_test
      f. subject_test.txt -> s_test
      g. features.txt -> features
      h. activity_labels.txt -> activities
   ii. Merge the datasets as below:
      a. s_train, s_test -> s_data
      b. y_train, y_test -> y_data
      c. x_train, x_test -> x_data
   iii. rename columns for all data sets
      a. s_data <- subject
      b. y_data <- activity
      c. x_data <- get column names from features data set
      d. activities <- activity, activityName
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and 
    standard deviation for each measurement.
  i. Get variables for mean and std
  ii. Extract columns for mean and std
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  i. Merge all datasets
  ii. Replace activity id with activity names
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  i. Get all column names
  ii. Find and replace short words with descriptive words:
      a. Find and replace '()' and '-' to empty string
      b. Find and replace 'mean' to 'Mean'
      c. Find and replace 'std' to 'StandardDeviation'
      d. Find and replace 'Acc' to 'Accelerometer'
      e. Find and replace 'Gyro' to 'Gyroscope'
      f. Find and replace 'Mag' to 'Magnitude'
      g. Find and replace 'BodyBody' to 'Body'
      h. Find and replace first 't' to 'Time'
      g. Find and replace first 'f' to 'Frequency'
  iii. Rename columns 
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  i. Group by and summarize data
  ii. output to file 'tidy_data.txt'
